## Hi there 👋 I'm Max

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Reading.  
I enjoy building graphics applications with **C++** and **OpenGL**. 

### What I’m Working On
- Developing my GraphicsEngine to become a simple, use-able program, with a reasonable level of abstraction.
- Exploring low-level rendering and graphics programming
- Experimenting with shaders and GPU optimization  
- Creating small OpenGL projects to visualize algorithms and physics
